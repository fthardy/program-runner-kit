#Program-Runner-Kit
Program-Runner-Kit aims to provide yet another small (yet micro) framework that helps with the creation of a main 
and/or bootstrap routine for a Java-Programm. 

The idea is (as is so often the case) on the one hand to provide a corresponding structure and framework, as well as 
to reduce the technical boiler-plate-code to a minimum while building startup-logic.

I know, there are a lot of solutions for this problem out there but for me none of these solutions matched my 
personal needs/requirements. So I started to create my very own one. Hey! Why not reinvent the wheel. At least it's my 
private time I'm "wasting" for this. ;-)

However, the work is in progress and we'll see how far I'll get in the future... :-)
